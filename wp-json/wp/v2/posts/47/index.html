Today, such smart communities are highly heterogeneous and siloed as they can offer IoT applications and ser- vices only to their local community inhabitants. ComDeX uses prop- erty graphs to represent smart community entities and automatically maps them to context-aware publish\/subscribe messages. Such messages can be discovered and exchanged between communities via a hierarchical federated topology and an advertisement-based mechanism. The ComDeX prototype is implemented using well- known IoT technologies such as MQTT and NGSI-LD. ComDeX is evaluated using a realistic smart port scenario and compared against different federation topologies. The experimental results demon- strate that our approach outperforms existing NGSI-LD solutions in realistic IoT scenarios with synthetically generated workloads, with low impact in larger deployments where the number of hops between brokers of the federation increases<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ComDeX is a context-aware federated architecture and IoT platform for enabling data exchange between IoT- enhanced communities.
